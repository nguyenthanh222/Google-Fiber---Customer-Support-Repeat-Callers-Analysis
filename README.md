## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to improve **First Contact Resolution (FCR)** for Google Fiber's customer service team by identifying root causes of repeat inquiries. High repeat caller volume directly impacts operational costs and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Consolidate Data:** Merge fragmented datasets from three different markets into a unified "Single Source of Truth".
* **Trend Analysis:** Monitor repeat caller volume across different timeframes (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly).
* **Identify Drivers:** Isolate issue types (Technical, Billing, Setup) that cause the most secondary inquiries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Processing:** Google BigQuery (SQL) for ETL and data unification using `UNION ALL` for scalability.
* **Visualization:** Tableau for building an interactive storytelling interface.

## 💡 Key Insights
* **Technical Friction:** "Technical Setup" issues showed a **15% higher repeat rate** within the first 7 days, indicating a need for improved self-installation guides.
* **Market Benchmarking:** Market 2 achieved a downward trend in repeat calls following new agent training, serving as a "Best Practice" model for other regions.

## 📂 Project Structure
